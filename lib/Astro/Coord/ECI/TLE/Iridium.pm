Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE::Iridium - Compute behavior of Iridium satellites

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The following is a semi-brief script to calculate Iridium flares. You
will need to substitute your own location where indicated.

 # and longitude west, in RADIANS, and height above sea
 # level in KILOMETERS.

=head1 NOTICE -- IRIDIUM SUPPORT

As of early 2017 the flaring Iridium satellites are being taken out of
service, to be replaced by non-flaring Iridium Next satellites. Once the
flaring Iridium satellites are out of service, I plan to deprecate and
remove all functionality relating to the acquisition of Iridium status.

I have not yet decided on the disposition of
L<Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE::Iridium|Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE::Iridium>. My
thought at the moment is that it will be moved to its own package rather
than deleted, because the flare functionality may be of historical
interest. By the same reasoning, the TLE parsing logic in
L<Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE|Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE> will remain able to
rebless satellites as Iridium, but the canned status will be 'tumbling'.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a subclass of
L<Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE|Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE>, representing
original-design Iridium satellites. This class will probably B<not> work
for the Iridium Next satellites, which are being launched starting early
2017.

The C<< Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE->parse() >> method makes use of
built-in data to determine which satellites to rebless into this class,
based on the object's NORAD SATCAT ID. This internal data can be
modified using the Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE->status method to correct
errors or for historical research. It is also possible to get an Iridium
object by calling $tle->rebless (iridium => {status => $status})
directly.

What this subclass adds is the ability to generate information on
Iridium flares (or glints, as they are also called). Members of this
class are considered capable of generating flares based on their status,
as follows:

 0 => in service
 1 => spare (may or may not flare)
 2 => failed - no predictable flares.

CelesTrak-style statuses ('+', 'S', and '-' respectively) are accepted
on input. See L<Astro::SpaceTrack|Astro::SpaceTrack> method
iridium_status for a way to get current Iridium constellation status.

#	Pre-compute the transform vectors for each of the three Main
#	Mission Antennae, so that we do not have to repeatedly compute
#	the sin and cos of the relevant angles. The transform we are
#	doing is a rotation of theta radians about the Z axis (theta
#	being Main Mission Antenna index * 2 * PI / 3) to face the
#	MMA in the X direction, followed by a rotation of phi radians
#	about the Y axis (phi being -130 degrees) to lay the MMA back
#	into the X-Y plane.

#	Although we are using vector math for the actual operation, the
#	transform vectors are derived using matrix math, with the
#	resultant matrix being decomposed into the row vectors we need.
#	The actual computation is to premultiply the theta transform
#	matrix by the phi transform matrix:

=item $tle->after_reblessing (\%attribs);

This method supports reblessing into a subclass, with the argument
representing attributes that the subclass may wish to set. It is called
by rebless() and should not be called by the user.

At this level of the inheritance hierarchy, it sets the status of the
object from the {status} key of the given hash. If this key is absent,
the object is assumed capable of generating flares.

=item $tle->before_reblessing ()

This method supports reblessing into a subclass. It is intended to do
any cleanup the old class needs before reblessing into the new class. It
is called by rebless(), and should not be called by the user.

At this level of the inheritance hierarchy, it removes the status
attribute.

=item $tle->can_flare ($spare);

This method returns true (in the Perl sense) if the object is capable
of producing flares, and false otherwise. If the optional $spare
argument is true, spares are considered capable of flaring, otherwise
not. If C<$spare> is C<'all'>, then all objects are considered capable
of flaring.

=cut

sub can_flare {
    my ( $self, $spare ) = @_;
    defined $spare
	and 'all' eq $spare
	and return 1;
    my $status = $self->get ('status');
    return !$status || $spare && $status == $self->BODY_STATUS_IS_SPARE;
}


=item @flares = $tle->flare ($sta, $start, $end);

This method returns the list of flares produced by the given Iridium
satellite at the given station between the given start time and the
given end time. This list may be empty. If called in scalar context you
get the number of flares.

All arguments are optional, with the defaults being

 $station = the 'station' attribute
 $start = time()
 $end = $start + 1 day

Each flare is represented by a reference to an anonymous hash, with
elements as follows:

 angle => Mirror angle, radians
 appulse => information about the position of the Sun
   angle => distance from Sun to flare, radians
   body => reference to the Sun object
 area => Projected MMA area, square radians
 azimuth => Azimuth of flare, radians
 body => Reference to object producing flare
 center => information about the center of the flare
   body => location of the center of the flare
   magnitude => estimated magnitude at the center
 elevation => Elevation of flare, radians
 magnitude => Estimated magnitude
 mma => Flaring mma (0, 1, or 2)
 range => Range to flare, kilometers
 specular => True if specular reflection
 station => reference to the observer's location
 status => ''
 type => Type of flare (see notes)
 time => Time of flare
 virtual_image => Location of virtual image

Note that:

* The time of the object passed in the {body} element is not
necessarily set to the time of the flare.

* The {center}{body} element contains an Astro::Coord::ECI object
set to the location of the center of the flare at the given time.
The center is defined as the intersection of the plane of the
observer's horizon with the line from the virtual image of the
illuminating body through the flaring satellite.

* The {mma} element indicates which Main Mission Antenna generated
the flare. The antennae are numbered clockwise (looking down on the
vehicle) from the front, so 0, 1, and 2 correspond to Heavens Above's
'Front', 'Right', and 'Left' respectively.

* The {specular} element is actually the limb darkening factor if
applicable. Otherwise, it is 1 if the reflection is specular, and 0 if
not.

* The {status} key is reserved for an explanation of why there is no
flare. When the hash is generated by the flare() method, this key will
always be false (in the Perl sense).

* The {type} element contains 'day' if the flare occurs between the
beginning of twilight in the morning and the end of twilight in the
evening, 'am' if the flare is after midnight but not during the day,
and 'pm' if the flare is before midnight but not during the day.

* The {virtual_image} element is an Astro::Coord::ECI object
representing the location of the virtual image of the illuminator
at the time of the flare.

Why does this software produce different results than
L<http://www.heavens-above.com/>?

The short answer is "I don't know, because I don't know how Heavens
Above gets their answers."

In a little more detail, there appear to be several things going on:

First, there appears to be no standard reference for how to calculate
the magnitude of a flare. This module calculates specular reflections
as though the sky were opaque, and the flaring Main Mission Antenna
were a window through to the virtual image of the Sun. Limb darkening
is taken into account, as is atmospheric extinction. Non-specular
flares are calculated by a fairly arbitrary equation whose coefficients
were fitted to visual flare magnitude estimates collected by Ron Lee
and made available on the Web by Randy John as part of his skysat
web site at L<http://home.comcast.net/~skysat/>. Atmospheric extinction
is also taken into account for the non-specular flares.

Atmospheric extinction is calculated according to the article by Daniel
W.  Green in the July 1992 issue of "International Comet Quarterly", and
available at L<http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/ICQExtinct.html>. Because
Heavens Above does not display flares dimmer than a certain magnitude
(-6 for day flares, and apparently 0 for night flares), it may not
display a flare that this code predicts. I have no information how
Heavens Above calculates magnitudes, but I find that this class gives
estimates about a magnitude brighter than Heavens Above at the dim end
of the scale.

Second, I suspect that the positions and velocities calculated by
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE differ slightly from those used by Heavens Above.
I do not know this, because I do not know what positions Heavens Above
uses, but there are slight differences among the results of all the
orbital propagation models I have looked at. All I can say about the
accuracy of Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE is that it duplicates the test data
given in "Spacetrack Report Number Three". But small differences are
important -- 0.1 degree at the satellite can make the difference between
seeing and not seeing a flare, and smaller differences can affect the
magnitude predictions, especially if they make the difference between
predicting a specular or non-specular flare. Occasionally I find that I
get very different results than Heavens Above, even when using orbital
data published on that web site.

Third, Heavens Above issues predictions on satellites that my source
says are spares. I have skipped the spares by default because I do not
know that their attitudes are maintained to the requisite precision,
though perhaps they would be, to demonstrate that the spares are
functional. This software currently uses the Iridium status from
CelesTrak (L<http://celestrak.com/SpaceTrack/query/iridium.txt>), since
it represents one-stop shopping, and Dr. Kelso has expressed the intent
to check with Iridium Satellite LLC monthly for status. Mike McCants'
"Status of Iridium Payloads" at
L<http://users2.ev1.net/~mmccants/tles/iridium.html> notes that flares
may be unreliable for spares, so can_flare () returns false for them. If
this is not what you want, call can_flare with a true value (e.g.
can_flare(1)).

Fourth, the Heavens Above definition of 'daytime' differs from mine.
Heavens Above does not document what their definition is, at least
not that I have found. My definition of daytime includes twilight,
which by default means the center of the Sun is less than 6 degrees
below the horizon. I know that, using that definition, this software
classifies some flares as daytime flares which Heavens Above classifies
as nighttime flares. It appears to me that Heavens Above considers it
night whenever the Sun is below the horizon.

Fifth, the orbital elements used to make the prediction can differ.
I have occasionally seen Heavens Above using elements a day old,
versus the ones available from Space Track, and seen this difference
make a difference of six or eight seconds in the time of the flare.

Sixth, this method takes no account of the decrease in magnitude that
would result from the Sun being extremely close to the horizon as seen
from the flaring satellite. I do not know whether Heavens Above does
this or not, but I have seen an instance where this code predicted a
flare but Heavens Above did not, where the observed flare was much
dimmer than this code predicted, and reddened. Subsequent calculations
put the Sun 0.1 degrees above the horizon as seen from the satellite.

B<NOTE> that the algorithm used to calculate flares does not work at
latitudes beyond 85 degrees north or south, nor does it work for any
location that is not fixed to the Earth's surface. This may be fixed in
a future release. The chances of it being fixed in a future release will
be enhanced if someone claims to actually need it. This someone will be
invited to help test the new code.

B<NOTE also> that as of version 0.002_01 of this class, the 'backdate'
attribute determines whether a set of orbital elements can be used for
computations of flares before the epoch of the elements. If 'backdate'
is false and the start time passed to flare() is earlier than the epoch,
the start time is silently moved forward to the epoch. The initial
version of this functionality raised an exception if this adjustment
placed the start time after the end time, but as of version 0.003_01 of
this class, you simply get no flares if this happens.

#	least unsatisfied) with a linear regression on
#	ln (8 - magnitude), with the 8 picked because it was the
#	maximum possible magnitude.
#	Maybe I could have done better with a larger arbitrary
#	constant, since the data sags a bit in the middle versus the
#	regression line, but there is a fair amount of scatter anyway.

#	All this means that the calculation is
#	mag = 8 - exp (-5.1306 * angle_in_radians + 2.4128) +
#		intensity_to_magnitude (area / 1e-12) +
#		atmospheric_refraction (elevation, height)
#	The R-squared for this is .563.

#	There are several possible sources of error:

#	* My mirror angle is defined slightly different than Randy
#	  John's. Mine is the angle between the satellite and the
#	  virtual image of the Sun as seen by the observer. His is the
#	  angle between the actual reflection and a central specular
#	  reflection, which I take to be 180 degrees minus the angle
#	  between the Sun and the observer as seen from the satellite.
#	  This makes my angle slightly smaller than his, the difference
#	  being the angle between the observer and the satellite as
#	  seen from the Sun, something on the order of 0.01 degrees or
#	  less. This is probably not directly a source of error (since
#	  I used my own calculation of mirror angle), but needs to be
#	  taken into account when evaluating the other sources of
#	  error.

#	* My calculated mirror angles are different than Randy John's
#	  by an amount which is typically about a tenth of a degree,
#	  but which can be on the order of a couple degrees. Since I
#	  do not currently have any Wintel hardware, I can not tell
#	  how much of this is difference in calculation and how much
#	  is difference in orbital elements.

#	* The error between the visually estimated magnitudes and the
#	  actual magnitudes is unknown. In theory, visual estimates are
#	  fairly good given a number of nearby comparison stars of
#	  magnitudes near the body to be estimated. How the ephemeral
#	  nature of the flares affects the accuracy of this process is
#	  not known to me. What happens with magnitudes brighter than
#	  about -1, where there are no comparison objects available is
#	  also unknown, as is the actual methodology of making the
#	  estimates.

#	Note to me: the current estimate was done with
#	perl process.pl -quiet -specular -radians -constant 8
#	The previous was done with
#	perl process.pl -specular -radians, but the correlation was
#	done in a spreadsheet (normalized2.ods)

=item $mag = $tle->magnitude( $station );

This override of the superclass' method method returns the magnitude of
the body as seen from the given station at the body's currently-set
time. If no C<$station> is specified, the object's C<'station'>
attribute is used.  If that is not set, and exception is thrown.

This method calls the superclass' C<magnitude()>, and returns C<undef>
if the superclass does. Otherwise it adds to the magnitude of the body
itself the magnitude of any flare in progress, and returns the result.

    my ( $self, $sta ) = __default_station( @_ );

}


=item @data = $tle->reflection ($station, $time)

This method returns a list of references to hashes containing the same
data as returned for a flare, calculated for the given observer and time
for all Main Mission Antennae. If C<$time> is C<undef>, the current time
setting of the invocant is used. If C<$station> is C<undef> the current
C<station> attribute is used. Note the following differences from the
flare() hash:

If the hash contains a 'status' key which is true (in the Perl sense),
no reflection occurred, and the content of the key is a message saying
why not. If the 'mma' key exists in addition to the 'status' key, the
failure applies only to that MMA, and other MMAs may possibly generate a
reflection. If the 'mma' key does not exist, then the satellite is
either not illuminated or below the horizon for the given observer, and
the @data list will contain only a single entry.

Other than (maybe) 'mma', no other keys should be assumed to exist if
the 'status' key is true.

If called in scalar context, a reference to the \@data list is returned.

B<NOTE> that prior to 0.061_01 the C<$time> argument defaulted to the
current time. This behavior was undocumented, and therefore I felt free
to change it.

=head2 Attributes

This class adds the following attributes:

=over

=item am (boolean)

If true, the flare() method returns flares that occur between midnight
and morning twilight. If false, such flares are ignored.

The default is 1 (i.e. true).

=item day (boolean)

If true, the flare() method returns flares that occur between morning
twilight and evening twilight. If false, such flares are ignored.

The default is 1 (i.e. true).

=item extinction (boolean)

If true, flare magnitude calculations will take atmospheric extinction
into account. If false, they will not. The observer who wishes to
compare forecast magnitudes to nearby stars may wish to set this to some
value Perl considers false (e.g. undef).

The default is 1 (i.e. true).

=item intrinsic_magnitude (numeric or undef)

This attribute is inherited from the parent class, but unlike the parent
(which defaults it to C<undef>), this class defaults it to C<7.0>, which
is the average intrinsic magnitude for an Iridium satellite.

=item max_mirror_angle (angle in radians)

This attribute is used in the flare calculation to screen passes for
flare potential. The position of the satellite is calculated at
intervals during a pass, and for each position the mirror angle (defined
as the angle subtended at the satellite between the observer and the
reflection of the Sun) is calculated. If no calculated mirror angle is
less than the value of this attribute, no flare is predicted. If one of
the mirror angles B<is> less than this, a flare is predicted and its
maximum magnitude calculated.

The default value is equivalent to 10 degrees. This is fine for fairly
bright flares, but if you are looking for really dim ones (relative to
the maximum brightness given the source of illumination) you want to
increase this. The cost of increasing it is, of course, increased
computation. The maximum useful value is the equivalent of 180 degrees,
but this is not enforced. If you have a particular angle in mind, you
will want to set this to about 10 degrees more, because of the way it is
used in the flare algorithm.

=item pm (boolean)

If true, the flare() method returns flares that occur between evening
twilight and midnight. If false, such flares are ignored.

The default is 1 (i.e. true).

=item status (integer)

This attribute determines whether the Iridium satellite is considered
able to produce predictable flares. The possible values are:

 0 => in service;
 1 => spare, or maneuvering;
 2 => out of service, tumbling, et cetera;
 3 => decayed.

By default, the can_flare() method returns true only if the status is 0.
But if given a true argument (e.g. can_flare(1)) it will also return true
if the status is 1.

When setting this attribute, both T. S. Kelso and Mike McCants style
strings are accepted. That is:

 '+' or '' will be considered 0;
 'S' or '?' will be considered 1;
 anything else will be considered 2.

Technically, the default is 0. But if the object is manufactured by
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE->parse(), the status will be set based on the
internal status table in Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE.

B<Note> that Mike McCants' Iridium statuses are no longer maintained, so
his status codes (C<''> and C<'?'>) are being put through a deprecation
cycle. In 6 months they will warn on the first use; 6 months after that
they will warn on every use, and 6 months after that they will become
fatal.

=item zone (number or string)

This attribute is used to determine whether a flare took place in the
C<am> or C<pm>. It can be set to a number of possible values:

* C<undef> causes the computation to be done in the local zone, whatever
that is.

* A numeric value is interpreted as an offset in hours east of
Greenwich; hours west are negative.

* Anything else is interpreted as a zone name. If L<DateTime|DateTime>
is available, it is used to convert the time to the named zone, throwing
an exception if the zone name is not recognized.

Otherwise, $ENV{TZ} is set to the zone, and then C<localtime()> is
called. Whether this has the desired effect depends on your operating
system.

Yes, this is a bit of a crock, but I realized (B<after> putting out
0.036, with the Iridium flare tests that anyone can run) that I needed
to do B<something> to get a user's-zone-independent test.

The default is C<undef>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The author wishes to acknowledge the following people, without
whose work this module would never have existed:

Ron Lee and the members of his team who collected Iridium magnitude
data.

Randy John, the author of SKYSAT (L<http://home.comcast.net/~skysat/>),
whose Turbo Pascal implementation of the geometry calculation (at
L<http://home.comcast.net/~skysat/algo.txt> provided the basic mechanism
for my own geometry calculation, and who made Ron Lee's data available
on the SKYSAT web site.

The contributors to the Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page
(L<http://www.satobs.org/satintro.html>), particularly the
Iridium Flares page (L<http://www.satobs.org/iridium.html>),
which provided the background for the entire Iridium flare
effort.
